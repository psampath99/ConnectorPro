- **ConnectorPro Agent:** "I found 8 relevant people at Stripe for product marketing roles! Here are your top 3 targets with the strongest introduction paths:

  1. **Sarah Chen, Senior Product Marketing Manager** - Best bridge: Alex Kumar (your ex-Google colleague, 2019-2021 overlap)
  2. **Mike Rodriguez, VP Product Marketing** - Best bridge: Priya Patel (UCLA '18 classmate, both in Marketing Club)  
  3. **Jennifer Liu, Product Marketing Lead** - Best bridge: David Park (mutual connection through RevOps Collective)

  Would you like me to draft an introduction request for any of these paths?"

- **User:** "Yes, create an intro request via Alex for Sarah Chen"
- **ConnectorPro Agent:** "Perfect! I'll create an introduction request for Alex that highlights your shared Google experience on the Ads team. Here's a draft that leads with your strongest commonality:

  *Subject: Quick intro request - fellow Google Ads alum*
  
  *Hi Alex, Hope you're doing well! I'm reaching out because I remember you mentioning your connection to Stripe during our Google days. I'm exploring product marketing opportunities and would love a brief intro to Sarah Chen if you think it makes sense. We both worked on the Google Ads team (you were there when I joined in 2019), so I thought you'd be a credible bridge. Happy to send more context if helpful. Thanks for considering! - Maya*

  Would you prefer to send this via LinkedIn or Gmail?"

- **User:** "Gmail please, and suggest a follow-up meeting"
- **ConnectorPro Agent:** "Great choice! I'll prepare this for Gmail - just confirm Alex's email address when you're ready to send. After Sarah responds positively, I can help you set up a 20-minute intro call with a Google Meet link. The meeting invite will reference your Google connection and product marketing focus. Ready to send the intro request?"
