# 1) Executive Summary
- This document outlines the backend development plan for ConnectorPro, an AI-powered LinkedIn networking assistant.
- The plan adheres to the following constraints: FastAPI (Python 3.12), MongoDB Atlas with Motor, no Docker, and a frontend-driven manual testing strategy using a `main`-only Git workflow.
- The project will be developed over a series of sprints, dynamically adjusted to cover all frontend features, starting with LinkedIn data integration.

# 2) In-scope & Success Criteria
- **In-scope Features:**
  - LinkedIn network data import and analysis.
  - User authentication (signup, login, logout).
  - Contact management and relationship mapping.
  - AI-powered conversational assistant for networking guidance.
  - Personalized message drafting.
- **Success Criteria:**
  - All frontend features are fully supported by the backend API.
  - Each development sprint passes a manual testing phase conducted through the frontend UI.
  - Successful sprints are committed and pushed to the `main` branch on GitHub.

      }
      ```

# 5) Frontend Audit & Feature Map
- **Routes/Components:**
  - `frontend/src/pages/Contacts.tsx`: Displays contact lists, filters, and bridge recommendations.
    - **Backend Capability:** `GET /api/v1/contacts`, `GET /api/v1/contacts/{contact_id}`.
  - `frontend/src/pages/Network.tsx`: Visualizes network statistics and connection paths.
    - **Backend Capability:** `GET /api/v1/contacts` (for aggregation).
  - `frontend/src/components/onboarding/OnboardingFlow.tsx`: (Assumed) Handles initial user setup, including LinkedIn data import.
    - **Backend Capability:** `POST /api/v1/contacts/import`.
- **Authentication:**
  - The application requires user signup and login, which will be handled by the auth endpoints. Protected routes will require a valid JWT.

# 6) Configuration & ENV Vars (core only)
- `APP_ENV`: `development`
- `PORT`: `8000`
- `MONGODB_URI`: (To be provided by the user)
- `JWT_SECRET`: A long, random, and secret string.
- `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`: `3600` (1 hour)
- `CORS_ORIGINS`: The frontend application's URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5137`).

# 9) Testing Strategy (Manual via Frontend)
- **Policy:** All backend features will be validated by interacting with the frontend UI. The browser's Network tab in DevTools will be used to inspect API requests and responses.
- **Per-sprint Manual Test Checklist (Frontend):** Each sprint will include a detailed list of UI steps to verify the implemented features.
- **User Test Prompt:** A concise set of instructions will be provided for a non-technical user to test the functionality.
- **Post-sprint:** If all tests pass, the code will be committed and pushed to the `main` branch on GitHub.

# 10) Dynamic Sprint Plan & Backlog (S0â€¦Sn)
- **S0 - Environment Setup & Frontend Connection**
